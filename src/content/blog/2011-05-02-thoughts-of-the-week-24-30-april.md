Busy busy last week. But still got a lot of time to think on my way back home.
-Only two things that you should aim for - happy teams and delighted customers. Choose any process that gives you these. Why I favor Agile? Because I have seen it deliver these two things time and time again.
-The dictionary meaning of estimate - es·ti·mate/-mit/ - Noun: An approximate calculation or judgment of the value, number, quantity, or extent of something. Wonder when the IT industry turned estimates to contracts??
-If I were to hire me, what would I pay myself? Crazy thought.
-Need to read this daily - <a title="http://mmiika.wordpress.com/oo-design-principles/" href="http://mmiika.wordpress.com/oo-design-principles/">http://mmiika.wordpress.com/oo-design-principles/</a>
-The organization hired you for a reason. So while being flexible, one should not change his/her principles to fit in the organization. Because what makes you special is your uniqueness :).
-Practical never changed the world (oldie but a goldie).
-It takes a lot of effort to keep things simple. Making complex solutions is way too easy.
-Joke between Indian developers - Developer 1 : "You know, I went to XYZ country and the office was empty by 6 PM". Everyone else laughs their socks off. I don't know whether to smile or frown.
-I think I have have turned a corner. I now think what is the minimum amount of money I need, I plan to have no mortgage/home loan, pay off my car loan and see what is the minimum salary I can get by. Then I can concentrate on other important things.
