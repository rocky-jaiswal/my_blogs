A long time back (when I had more hair on my head), one of my managers remarked - "You know guys, I just met an old friend of mine who now works for ABC Corp as a Project Manager and he said that he delivered a 18 months fixed price project right on time and right on schedule. We need to have the same capabilities as ABC Corp." 

I sat dumbfounded, I wanted to scream out "He was just lucky or he was lying or you should talk to the team members who worked in that team", but I didn't say anything because pesky "juniors" aren't looked upon very nicely in hierarchical organizations.

I now imagine myself having a conversation with the same manager in that same room, which goes something like this. 

__Me__ - "Lets play a game. Please indulge me. Can you tell me in exact seconds, the time you will take to reach the nearest door in this room."

__Manager__ - "Yes, around 10 seconds."

__Me__ - "Good. How can you say that?"

__Manager__ - "Coz its 15 feet and I think I can cover 15 feet in 10 seconds."

__Me__ - "Fair enough. Now can you tell me the time it will take for you to reach London from Delhi in exact number of seconds. Forget seconds, tell me in minutes."

__Manager__ - (after a pause) "Well, depending on flight time and the distance to airport approx 600 minutes."

__Me__ - "I have to tell you that even if there is one minute of delay, there is a huge penalty and what if your taxi is late or the flight is delayed ?"

__Manager__ - "One cannot say for sure. In fact, no one can tell you with exact certainty because too many un-predictable things can happen."

__Me__ - "How many times have you been to London?"

__Manager__ - "More than 8 times ."

__Me__ - "So you cannot say for certainty the exact time you will take for something which you have done for more than 8 times. But you could tell me the exact time you will take to reach for a nearby door. Why is that?"

__Manager__ - "Coz I can see the door. Geez, are you thick or something."

__Me__ - "Yes, I have always been a bit thick. But let us apply this analogy to software. You want me to tell you for sure the exact time it will take for me to develop a software which is unique in its own way and which no-one has developed before. But you yourself cannot tell me the exact time you will take to reach London although you have done it more than 8 times."

__Manager__ - "Hmmm ... what are you getting at?"

__Me__ - "What I am saying is, as you increase the distance or time horizon, uncertainty increases."

__Manager__ - "That is quite true."

__Me__ - "Yes, so what I can only say with a fair degree of certainty is where we will be in this project after 1-2 weeks."

__Manager__ - "You maybe right, but that is not how it works. The customer asks how long will it take to build the whole thing."

__Me__ - "Why do think they do that?"

__Manager__ - "I guess they feel safe this way, they can allocate a budget to it."

__Me__ - "Again, I am a bit thick. So a customer looks at a project, lets say a Reporting System and thinks this work should take 6 months to build for 4 people ergo the time is 6 months and budget is $10,000 or something like that. Do they have the expertise to make this call?"

__Manager__ - "Hmmm .. maybe they have the expertise or maybe they don't and sometimes they even ask us to do this."

__Me__ - "I am not getting it, why do they do this every single time if it is so error prone and they do not trust even themselves."

__Manager__ - "Coz maybe they feel safe."

__Me__ - "Ok. So they allocate a budget and outsource to project to someone, asking them to complete it in 6 months or give a penalty. They can sleep easy this way."

__Manager__ - "Yes. I think that's it!"

__Me__ - "But if I say, I will give it my best and give you a commitment for only the next two weeks of work and see how it goes from there. What would a customer say."

__Manager__ - "I don't think he would agree."

__Me__ - "Why?"

__Manager__ - "Coz he doesn't know when his project will end ?"

__Me__ - "But I am working hard and in the best way I can. Which is in no way different than the 6 months commitment I make."

__Manager__ - "But he wants a deadline, what if you are slacking?"

__Me__ - "Bingo!! Its because the work is done somewhere in a different location and you cannot trust someone is why you want deadlines."

__Manager__ - "Yes, I guess that is what outsourcing is about."

__Me__ - "But if you trust me as your partner who is fully committed to the project, does the two week commitment sound good."

__Manager__ - "Yes. I think so. But I still don't buy it. We have delivered many projects on time after giving a long term commitment."

__Me__ - "We all know how that happens. People spend nights in office and quality goes for a toss. Giving the same international travel analogy you put a gun to the pilots head and ask him to fly fast coz you made a commitment to reach London in 10 hours. Except you cannot do that on a plane but you can do it with us developers. Geez... and then people complain about the high rate of software project failures and late bug discovery."

__Manager__ - "Hmmm..."

__Me__ - "If I say there is a clause that no-one will work beyond 9 hours, how many of your so called successful commitments be successful ?"

__Manager__ - "Not a lot."

__Me__ - "Just because you can do it, doesn't mean you should."

__Manager__ - "I kinda agree, I remember my days when I had to spend 3 nights in the office to deliver a project and I can tell you the code we wrote was shit."

__Me__ - "And yet it continues. Why is that?"

__Manager__ - "You are irritating me. I say its again its because the customer wants a deadline. He cannot give us a free hand to deliver the project when we say its ready. They don't trust us that much."

__Me__ - "Yes. And that my friend is the problem. Trust. If you can monitor each and every second of my day I guess you would be very comfortable with the 2 week work schedule, lets call it a Sprint."

__Manager__ - "Yes. Good idea."

__Me__ - "If I give you a daily status report, put cameras in my working area and give you a working software demo every two weeks this trust can be built."

__Manager__ - "Sounds good. Maybe we can try it."

__Me__ - "Yes, lets build that trust by delivering high quality software regularly without making the team slog and lets make our customers really happy."

__Manager__ - "And what's there in it for the customer apart from your so called high quality?"

__Me__ - "We hear a lot of time, why isn't my software as reliable as my car or as reliable as the house I live in. I think the answer lies here. If I ask a car maker to make a car for me no matter what in 6 months or I ask a builder to build my house, flood or rain in 3 months before a brick is laid, I wouldn't be so comfortable in that car or house later. Software programming is even harder, there are new technologies, the user keeps changing his mind and numerous other un-certainties. Maybe if we follow this model, more software projects would be successful. Lets give it a shot."
