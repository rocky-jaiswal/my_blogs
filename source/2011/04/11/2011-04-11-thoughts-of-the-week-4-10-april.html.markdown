    <ul>
    	<li>If you can demo it, but the PO or Users cannot use it, it is not "Done".</li>
    	<li>Education in India is mostly seen as a ticket to a better life. Check all the right boxes and you just may get a better life. That is why there is lot of compliance but hardly any innovation.</li>
    	<li>Every time you commit your code. Ask yourself is it worth going out in the world? Is it worth putting against your name tag?</li>
    	<li>Bad code even if it is tested is technical debt because it will hurt you one day or another.</li>
    	<li>If you feel that someone in your organization will be happy because of the work you did when close your laptop, it is the best feeling you can have.</li>
    	<li>What do you work for? Is it to please your boss, or just because you love what you do?</li>
    </ul>
