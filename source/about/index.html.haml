		%h2 Profile
		%p
			Hi! I am Rocky. I am a professional software developer (or have been trying to be a good one) since 2002. I love to code, I like to help people through my code and I love to work with a team of good developers. I have some experience under my belt and I really like web and mobile app development. I am super interested in design, performance, data-modeling and shipping products fast.
		%p
			I have spoken at a few conferences, written a few blogs and created a popular screencast. I have developed numerous web applications, a few mobile apps and a couple of GIS applications. I have programmed for companies like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey&Company among other clients in the US, UK, Europe and Japan.
		%p
			I did a lot of Java early in my career, now I mostly work with JavaScript/TypeScript and Ruby. Occasionally I tinker with other programming languages like Clojure, Kotlin and Elixir.
