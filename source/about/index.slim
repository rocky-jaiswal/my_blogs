  p
    | Hi! I am Rocky. I am a software developer (or have been trying to be a good one) for the last thirteen years. I love to code, I like to help people through my code and I love to work with a team of good developers. I have some experience under my belt and I really like web and mobile app development. I am super interested in design, performance, data-modeling and shipping products fast.

    | I have spoken at a few conferences, written a few blogs and created a popular screencast. I have developed a lot of web applications, a few mobile apps and a couple of GIS applications. I have programmed for companies like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey&Company among other clients in the US, UK, Europe and Japan.

    | I did a lot of Java early in my career, now I mostly work with Ruby (it is an awesome language) and JavaScript. Occasionally I tinker with other programming languages like Scala, Clojure and Go.

  h3 Skills
  p I worked with Java for around eight years, for the last five years or so I have been programming in Ruby and JavaScript while experimenting with other languages along the way.

  p I claim to be an expert at nothing but I know the basics (OO & Clean Tested Code) and I learn quickly, eagerly and continuously.
