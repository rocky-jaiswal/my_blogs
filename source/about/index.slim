  h3 Skills
  p I worked for around eight years in Java, for the last three years or so I have been programming in Ruby and JavaScript while learning about Scala along the way. 

  p I claim to be an expert at nothing but I know the basics (OO & Clean Tested Code) and I learn quickly, eagerly and continuously.
