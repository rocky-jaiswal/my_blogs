<br/><h3>Skills</h3>
Java, Ruby / JRuby and JavaScript<br/>
I worked for around eight years in Java, for the last year or so I have been programming in Ruby and am learning JavaScript along the way. I claim to be an expert at nothing but I know the basics (OO & Clean Tested Code) and I learn quickly, eagerly and continuously.
