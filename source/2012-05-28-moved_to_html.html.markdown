I have recently moved the blog to pure HTML5 and CSS3 (as you can see) from Wordpress. It gives me more control over the layout, look and feel and also helps me express my ideas freely.

However, the migration is far from complete. Few of my older blog posts might not show up or look funny. I am working to fix this. I am really sorry for the inconvenice.

Some of your great comments have also been lost, something which I am again trying to fix.

On the flip side, the new blog is built with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), Twitter bootstrap (with a resposive twist) and my own Nginx setup so it should feel much snappier and work on multiple devices. You can check out the source code on [github](https://github.com/rocky-jaiswal/my_blogs).

Thanks for your patience.
