                <p>A long time back (when I had more hair on my head), one of my managers remarked - &#8220;You know guys, I just met an old friend of mine who now works for ABC Corp as a Project Manager and he said that he delivered a 18 months fixed price project right on time and right on schedule. We need to have the same capabilities as ABC Corp.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat dumbfounded, I wanted to scream out &#8220;He was just lucky or he was lying or you should talk to the team members who worked in that team&#8221;, but I didn&#8217;t say anything because pesky &#8220;juniors&#8221; aren&#8217;t looked upon very nicely in hierarchical organizations.</p>

<p>I now imagine myself having a conversation with the same manager in that same room, which goes something like this.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Lets play a game. Please indulge me. Can you tell me in exact seconds, the time you will take to reach the nearest door in this room.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Yes, around 10 seconds.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Good. How can you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Coz its 15 feet and I think I can cover 15 feet in 10 seconds.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Fair enough. Now can you tell me the time it will take for you to reach London from Delhi in exact number of seconds. Forget seconds, tell me in minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - (after a pause) &#8220;Well, depending on flight time and the distance to airport approx 600 minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;I have to tell you that even if there is one minute of delay, there is a huge penalty and what if your taxi is late or the flight is delayed ?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;One cannot say for sure. In fact, no one can tell you with exact certainty because too many un-predictable things can happen.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;How many times have you been to London?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;More than 8 times .&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;So you cannot say for certainty the exact time you will take for something which you have done for more than 8 times. But you could tell me the exact time you will take to reach for a nearby door. Why is that?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Coz I can see the door. Geez, are you thick or something.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Yes, I have always been a bit thick. But let us apply this analogy to software. You want me to tell you for sure the exact time it will take for me to develop a software which is unique in its own way and which no-one has developed before. But you yourself cannot tell me the exact time you will take to reach London although you have done it more than 8 times.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Hmmm &#8230; what are you getting at?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;What I am saying is, as you increase the distance or time horizon, uncertainty increases.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;That is quite true.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Yes, so what I can only say with a fair degree of certainty is where we will be in this project after 1-2 weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;You maybe right, but that is not how it works. The customer asks how long will it take to build the whole thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Why do think they do that?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;I guess they feel safe this way, they can allocate a budget to it.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Again, I am a bit thick. So a customer looks at a project, lets say a Reporting System and thinks this work should take 6 months to build for 4 people ergo the time is 6 months and budget is $10,000 or something like that. Do they have the expertise to make this call?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Hmmm .. maybe they have the expertise or maybe they don&#8217;t and sometimes they even ask us to do this.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;I am not getting it, why do they do this every single time if it is so error prone and they do not trust even themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Coz maybe they feel safe.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Ok. So they allocate a budget and outsource to project to someone, asking them to complete it in 6 months or give a penalty. They can sleep easy this way.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Yes. I think that&#8217;s it!&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;But if I say, I will give it my best and give you a commitment for only the next two weeks of work and see how it goes from there. What would a customer say.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he would agree.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Coz he doesn&#8217;t know when his project will end ?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;But I am working hard and in the best way I can. Which is in no way different than the 6 months commitment I make.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;But he wants a deadline, what if you are slacking?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Bingo!! Its because the work is done somewhere in a different location and you cannot trust someone is why you want deadlines.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Yes, I guess that is what outsourcing is about.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;But if you trust me as your partner who is fully committed to the project, does the two week commitment sound good.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Yes. I think so. But I still don&#8217;t buy it. We have delivered many projects on time after giving a long term commitment.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;We all know how that happens. People spend nights in office and quality goes for a toss. Giving the same international travel analogy you put a gun to the pilots head and ask him to fly fast coz you made a commitment to reach London in 10 hours. Except you cannot do that on a plane but you can do it with us developers. Geez&#8230; and then people complain about the high rate of software project failures and late bug discovery.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Hmmm&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;If I say there is a clause that no-one will work beyond 9 hours, how many of your so called successful commitments be successful ?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Not a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Just because you can do it, doesn&#8217;t mean you should.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;I kinda agree, I remember my days when I had to spend 3 nights in the office to deliver a project and I can tell you the code we wrote was shit.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;And yet it continues. Why is that?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;You are irritating me. I say its again its because the customer wants a deadline. He cannot give us a free hand to deliver the project when we say its ready. They don&#8217;t trust us that much.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Yes. And that my friend is the problem. Trust. If you can monitor each and every second of my day I guess you would be very comfortable with the 2 week work schedule, lets call it a Sprint.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Yes. Good idea.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;If I give you a daily status report, put cameras in my working area and give you a working software demo every two weeks this trust can be built.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;Sounds good. Maybe we can try it.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;Yes, lets build that trust by delivering high quality software regularly without making the team slog and lets make our customers really happy.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Manager</strong> - &#8220;And what&#8217;s there in it for the customer apart from your so called high quality?&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> - &#8220;We hear a lot of time, why isn&#8217;t my software as reliable as my car or as reliable as the house I live in. I think the answer lies here. If I ask a car maker to make a car for me no matter what in 6 months or I ask a builder to build my house, flood or rain in 3 months before a brick is laid, I wouldn&#8217;t be so comfortable in that car or house later. Software programming is even harder, there are new technologies, the user keeps changing his mind and numerous other un-certainties. Maybe if we follow this model, more software projects would be successful. Lets give it a shot.&#8221;</p>
