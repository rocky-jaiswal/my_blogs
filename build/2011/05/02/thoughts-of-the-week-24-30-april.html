                <p>Busy busy last week. But still got a lot of time to think on my way back home. -Only two things that you should aim for - happy teams and delighted customers. Choose any process that gives you these. Why I favor Agile? Because I have seen it deliver these two things time and time again. -The dictionary meaning of estimate - es·ti·mate/-mit/ - Noun: An approximate calculation or judgment of the value, number, quantity, or extent of something. Wonder when the IT industry turned estimates to contracts?? -If I were to hire me, what would I pay myself? Crazy thought. -Need to read this daily - <a href='http://mmiika.wordpress.com/oo-design-principles/' title='http://mmiika.wordpress.com/oo-design-principles/'>http://mmiika.wordpress.com/oo-design-principles/</a> -The organization hired you for a reason. So while being flexible, one should not change his/her principles to fit in the organization. Because what makes you special is your uniqueness :). -Practical never changed the world (oldie but a goldie). -It takes a lot of effort to keep things simple. Making complex solutions is way too easy. -Joke between Indian developers - Developer 1 : &#8220;You know, I went to XYZ country and the office was empty by 6 PM&#8221;. Everyone else laughs their socks off. I don&#8217;t know whether to smile or frown. -I think I have have turned a corner. I now think what is the minimum amount of money I need, I plan to have no mortgage/home loan, pay off my car loan and see what is the minimum salary I can get by. Then I can concentrate on other important things.</p>
